## Comprehension Test

### In Brief

A comprehension test will evaluate whether or not the customer understands the marketing message explaining the value proposition. This eliminates a possible false-negative bias on smoke tests where the customer indicates they do not want the value proposition when actually they do not understand it.

### Helps Answer

* Does the customer understand the value proposition?
* How could we explain the value proposition better?

### Tags

* Quantitative
* Qualitative
* Value proposition
* Smoke test

### Description

#### Time Commitment and Resources

* For B2C, it can take 1-2 hours offline or 24 hours online.&#x20;
* For B2B, participant recruitment times can vary widely.&#x20;
* 10-20 participants.

#### How to

* Write out value proposition in 1-3 sentences.
* Show the value proposition to a participant for a few moments, then remove it.
* Ask them to explain the value proposition in their own words from memory.

#### Interpreting Results

If the participant’s explanation is roughly comparable to our own, we count that as a positive result. If not, then it’s a negative. For this sort of test, we generally want a sample size of about 20 people and a positive conversion of about 80 percent.

The conversion has to be very high because regardless of what our value proposition is, people should understand it.

Take note: if many of the participants use identical language to explain the value proposition back, it should be considered as possible alternative marketing messages.

#### Potential Biases

* Confirmation bias: Overly enthusiastic entrepreneurs will sometimes over-explain, correct, or nonverbally prompt the participant with the correct answer.
* Invalid target audience: Participants do not need to be the target customers, but they must have the same level of language and vocabulary as the target customer (e.g., a junior marketing manager can stand in for a chief marketing officer).
* False negative: When using online surveys such as FiveSecondTest, the distractions of an online test can often result in a higher than normal failure rate.

#### Field Tips

* Run a comprehension test before a landing page test or you won’t understand why it doesn’t work. - @TriKro
