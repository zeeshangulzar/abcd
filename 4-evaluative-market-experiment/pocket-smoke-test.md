# Value Proposition Test - Pocket

## Pocket Smoke Test

### In Brief

This smoke test applies to physical goods or products with hardware components — at minimum a mobile phone. It entails interviewing a prospect or customer, then physically pulling a prototype out of our pocket and using the prototype to drive further discussion and exploration.

### Helps Answer

* Am I building the right product?
* Does the product have the right features or characteristics, relative to the value proposition?
* Does the user understand the product and its structure/architecture?
* How does the user expect to interact with the solution?
* Does the user understand how to achieve their goals using the product prototype?
* What constraints does the user have?&#x20;

### Description

This type of smoke test helps validate whether the type of solution is appropriate for the problem you want to solve. It's meant to start a discussion. You can lead with a number of questions, particularly to confirm the problem(s) you want to address.

By showing a specific solution to a voiced problem, you can go in much greater depth with questions. You can also observe how the user expects to use the product.

This is a smoke test. Treat the prototype as a conversation piece. You are focusing on the main "happy case." Is it something users want? Could it believably address their problem? It's fine for a prototype to be ugly, as long as you use it to learn something you didn't already know.

#### Time Commitment and Resources

Varies significantly on the actual product. On the low end, it's easy to use mobile phone mockup software to show the average person on the street a mobile phone app prototype. This takes a few hours in the hands of a decent designer using software like InVision or Prototyping on Paper (POP). You can create a simulated version using simple materials like wood and plastic, to discuss form factors for instance. On the high end, it might take a lot of time to design and source custom parts to build a prototype that addresses a specific pain point.

#### How to

1. Roughly sketch how the product should look. This can be very simple or a full electronics blueprint.&#x20;
2. Build or assemble the product (manually, 3d printing, Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, sensors, breadboards, etc.).
3. Show it to prequalified customers who have the problem you want to address.

#### Interpreting Results

Ask lots of questions about what the user would find valuable. Hone in on how your prototype differs from how they currently solve their problem(s).

#### Potential Biases

* Confirmation bias: Overly enthusiastic entrepreneurs will sometimes over-explain, correct, or nonverbally prompt the participant on how to use the prototype.
